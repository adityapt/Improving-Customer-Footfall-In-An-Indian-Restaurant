# Improving-Customer-Footfall-In-An-Indian-Restaurant
This project serves to explore the system bottlenecks of a small family owned restaurant. 
The main objective is to increase the customer satisfaction by reducing the average wait time 
a customer spends in the system. This is achieved by collecting data real time by visiting the 
restaurant at different times of the day and on different days. Various control and run charts 
as well as the process capability charts are created in Minitab and analyzed further with Six Sigma 
and DMAIC methodology and also using statistical inference.
